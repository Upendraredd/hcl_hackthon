) I have created Python-based CLI application for bank account creation and management using MySQL database.
2) I have imported required libraries i.e. MySQL connector, random 
3) Once I run the script, it will first attempt to connect to the MySQL database.
4) User will be prompted to enter your full name, 10-digit PAN number, and 12-digit Aadhaar number.
5) The script will query the database to check if an account with your PAN or Aadhaar already exists.
- If an account is found, its details will be displayed on the screen.
- If no account is found, the script will guide you through the new account creation process, asking for an account type and an initial deposit.
6) After the database insert operation is complete, the connection to the database will be closed.

Table_Name:- accounts

id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
        name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
        pan_number VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
